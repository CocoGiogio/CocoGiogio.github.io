      <h1>VPS W4R — CTF Write-up | Group Six</h1>
      <p class="lede">Summary of how we captured multiple flags from Group Six during a supervised in-class exercise.</p>
    </header>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="about-page">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>During the lab exercise we targeted Group Six's VPS. Their server had some misconfigurations that we were able to exploit, most notably an SSH service accessible with default credentials. From there we moved laterally to extract several flags (Devweb, WordPress, SQL, Gitea, FTP).</p>

      <h3>Key findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>SSH was accessible using default or weak credentials.</li>
        <li>Gitea contained exposed files with credentials and flags.</li>
        <li>WordPress database credentials were present on the filesystem.</li>
        <li>Database user had sufficient privileges to modify records.</li>
        <li>FTP user had a shell enabled which allowed SSH access.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Devweb Flag</h2>
      <p>While browsing their Gitea instance, my teammate discovered a repository or file containing the <strong>Devweb</strong> flag and accompanying credentials. This provided immediate access to the service responsible for that flag.</p>

      </figure>

      <h2>WordPress Flag</h2>
      <p>Because SSH was accessible with default credentials, we examined the filesystem and found a file containing the WordPress database credentials.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../vps_assets/group_6_creds.png"
             alt="Discovered WordPress DB credentials (anonymized)"

        <figcaption>Anonymized screenshot showing WordPress DB credentials discovered on the server.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Using the discovered DB credentials we connected to the database and enumerated the <code>wp_users</code> table. The user passwords were hashed:</p>

        <figcaption>wp_users table with hashed passwords (anonymized).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Cracking the hashes was not feasible within the exercise timeframe, but the DB user had sufficient privileges to update records. We executed an SQL update to overwrite the admin password with a known hash (authorized for the lab):</p>

        <figcaption>SQL query used to overwrite the WordPress admin password (anonymized).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>After updating the admin password we logged into <code>wp-login.php</code> and retrieved the WordPress flag.</p>

      <h2>SQL Flag</h2>
      <p>With DB access via the discovered credentials, we also queried the database directly to locate and extract the SQL flag.</p>

      <h2>Gitea & Root Flags</h2>
      <p>We used a social-engineering approach (simulated/authorized for the lab) via a spoofed Discord account to request flags from the target team after demonstrating a convincing message. The target provided the Gitea flag and subsequently the root flag.</p>

      <figure>

        <figcaption>Anonymized screenshot showing the Gitea flag received during the social-engineering exchange.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>FTP Flag</h2>
      <p>Once we had SSH access as the FTP user (their FTP account was left with an interactive shell), we navigated the user's home directory and found the FTP flag stored there.</p>

      <h3>Captured flags — summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Devweb flag</strong> — discovered in Gitea</li>
        <li><strong>WordPress flag</strong> — obtained by overwriting admin password via DB</li>
        <li><strong>SQL flag</strong> — extracted directly from the database</li>
        <li><strong>Gitea flag</strong> — received via authorized social engineering</li>
        <li><strong>Root flag</strong> — provided during the social-engineering exchange</li>
        <li><strong>FTP flag</strong> — found in the user's home directory after SSH access</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Notes on ethics & methodology</h3>
      <p>This exercise was performed in a controlled classroom environment with explicit permission from course staff. The write-up documents the methods used for learning and defensive purposes only. In real-world contexts, social engineering and credential misuse are sensitive techniques — always obtain explicit authorization before attempting any tests against third-party systems or individuals.</p>
